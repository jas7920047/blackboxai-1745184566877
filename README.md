# Step-by-Step Integration and Differentiation of f(x)

## Project Overview
This project is a web application that allows users to input mathematical functions and receive step-by-step guidance on how to integrate or differentiate them. It also visualizes the function graphically, providing an intuitive way to understand calculus concepts. Users can input polynomial and trigonometric functions and see the results instantly.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/integration-differentiation-app.git
   cd integration-differentiation-app
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

No additional installation of libraries or dependencies is required since all necessary scripts and styles are included via CDN.

## Usage
1. Enter a function of \( f(x) \) in the input field. You can use formats like:
   - Polynomial: `3x^2 + 2x - 5`
   - Trigonometric: `4sin(x) - cos(x)`

2. Choose whether to **Integrate** or **Differentiate** the function by clicking the corresponding button.

3. View the step-by-step calculations displayed below the input form and the graphical representation of the function on the graph.

## Features
- Step-by-step integration and differentiation of polynomial and trigonometric functions.
- User-friendly interface with responsive design.
- Graphical representation of the function using Chart.js.
- Error handling for invalid function input.

## Dependencies
The project uses the following external libraries:
- **Tailwind CSS** (for styling)
- **Font Awesome** (for icons)
- **Chart.js** (for graphing the function)

These libraries are included via CDN in the `index.html` file.
